My sister got a <a href="http://www.sony.com.my/sonystyle/product/productinfo_peraudio.asp?Subcategoryid=40" target="_blank">Sony WALKMAN NW-E013F</a> as a free gift recently and the installation of drivers continually terminated abruptly at about 70%. Initially she thought it was her fault but after some googling, it was Sony&#8217;s. >:| They somehow shipped CD-ROMs with defective drivers in them, which caused that installation troubles.

Taken from <a href="http://www.sonydigital-link.com/DNA/Downloads/downloads.asp?l=en&c=WM&sc=NWH&f=W2KPA_driver" target="_blank">here</a>:

> **Important information regarding the CD-ROM software supplied with the following WALKMAN: NW-E013/E015/E016/E013F/E015F/E016F**
> 
> Some CD-ROM provided with the above mentioned models may not be used. Therefore, the Hardware Operation Guide (PDF) may not be opened and the Driver for Microsoft Windows 2000 users may not be installed.

If you&#8217;re having the same issues, just get the drivers from <a href="http://www.sonydigital-link.com/DNA/Downloads/downloads.asp?l=en&c=WM&sc=NWH&f=W2KPA_driver" target="_blank">here</a> and it should install fine. ;)

And <a href="http://support.sony-europe.com/DNA/sonicstage/sstage_dl.asp?l=en" target="_blank">here</a>&#8216;s the link to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SonicStage" target="_blank">SonicStage</a> 4.3 which is the software used to transfer your music to the device (similar to how iTunes works with the iPod).

Sony Asia Pacific&#8217;s announcement regarding this issue can be found <a href="http://www.sony-asia.com/support/announcement/207726?site=hp_en_AP_i" target="_blank">here</a>.
