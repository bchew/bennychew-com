<a target="_blank" href="http://www.khimhoe.net/">Khim Hoe</a> recently told me about another web based RSS reader called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsalloy.com/">News Alloy</a>. After coming to a conclusion that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> was by far _irreplaceable_ in my previous <a target="_blank" href="https://bennychew.com/blog/2006/08/13/finding-a-replacement-for-bloglines-rss-reader/">blog entry</a> on RSS readers, I went to try it out since he said it was pretty decent.

Initial impressions was that it has a similar feel to Bloglines, but with more Web 2.0-_ish_ elements. As with my previous tests, I imported my Bloglines exported feeds into it. Importing went fine, but then a problem surfaced. Quite a fair bit of feeds which I knew were updated recently did not contain any entries in them which seemed something went wrong. The problem was that Newsalloy does not grab the feeds&#8217; entries immediately after being added and is probably added to some sort of queue.

The <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX</a> interface has a similar flaw to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsgator.com/">Newsgator</a> which is you would have to scroll down and up between reading feeds and going back to your feeds sidebar. After loading a few feeds that were available, I started to feel that they&#8217;ve tried to cramp too many icons/links onto the screen which made it feel cluttered. On the plus side, loading speed of feeds are pretty close to Bloglines.

I won&#8217;t be shifting from Bloglines to this, but for those who dislike Bloglines&#8217;s simplicity and Newsgator&#8217;s slowness, you could give this a shot.
