Sorry if there were people expecting updates here. :P Have been away to Canberra for 4 days last week for the recent <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mascavictoria.com/">MASCA NCG 2006</a> and just when I was about to get going with stuff last night, my ISP _decides_ to have <a target="_blank" href="http://whirlpool.net.au/article.cfm/1649">an outage</a>. It was a nice break though, being disconnected (although the amount of things that have piled up due to that is pretty scary).

Updates should resume shortly, hopefully..
