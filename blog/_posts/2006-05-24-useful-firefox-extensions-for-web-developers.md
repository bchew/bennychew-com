As a follow up the previous post, I thought I&#8217;ll post up on the Firefox extensions I found useful while I was doing my web development work on spherebox:

<a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/60/">Web Developer</a>
  
Has all the necessary tools for HTML, CSS, forms and the like. Probably a must have extension for those doing development work.

<a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1419/">IE Tab</a>
  
I wouldn&#8217;t really say it&#8217;s for web development only as I&#8217;ve been using it for some time for viewing pages that only display properly in IE. It makes a Firefox tab use the IE rendering engine with a single click.

Other web development related extensions which I have yet to try out are the <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1843/">FireBug</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kevinfreitas.net/extensions/linkchecker/">LinkChecker</a> extensions. The former is supposedly similar to Web Developer while the latter checks if the links on a page are still valid and highlights them accordingly.
