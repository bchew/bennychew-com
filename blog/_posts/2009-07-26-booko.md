Came across <a href="http://www.booko.com.au/" target="_blank">this site</a> when I was looking to buy a book, it does a search across multiple online sites and points you to the place where you can get it for the best price. Got my book from the <a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/" target="_blank">Book Depository</a> which surprisingly does not charge for shipping even though it&#8217;s based in UK (and shipping time was incredibly quick!).
