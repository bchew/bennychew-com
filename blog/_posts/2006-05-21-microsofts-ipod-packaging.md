This clip is quite old (by internet standards, probably very :P) as it&#8217;s been around for a few months, but I thought I&#8217;ll just post it up since I just went through my Box.net account and came across it. It&#8217;s probably floating around on sites like Youtube and Google Video, but if you haven&#8217;t seen it (or if want to view it again ;)), here&#8217;s the high quality version (about 17MB in size).

The clip makes fun of Microsoft&#8217;s method of packaging as compared to Apple&#8217;s minimalist nature towards things. Link <a target="_blank" href="http://www.box.net/public/6lmqzyherz">here</a>.
