For starters, it has not hogged up to 500+MB of memory after a couple of hours, no crashes thus far too. Besides that, the new <a href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/firefox/features/#location-bar" target="_blank">location bar</a> (a.k.a. AwesomeBar) is simply fantastic. Most extensions have been updated to work with the latest version but you may have to switch to different ones if they aren&#8217;t updated anymore (or do some workarounds). Go get your copy of Firefox 3 <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" target="_blank">here</a>.

While on the subject of Firefox 3, BBspot has an article on it <a href="http://www.bbspot.com/News/2008/06/microsoft-abandons-internet-explorer-8.html" target="_blank">here</a>. And before you go about saying &#8216;about time!&#8217;, BBspot is a satire news site. :P
