That was the error code which I encountered while trying to install <a target="_blank" href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> on the server at work which ran on Windows Server 2003. The installer actually executed but threw that &#8216;setup file could not be found&#8217; error just after selecting the destination directory for the install. Initial _googling_ for this gave results which were along the lines of &#8216;clean the CD as it may be dirty&#8217; didn&#8217;t make much sense since it was being installed from the hard disk itself!

<a target="_blank" href="http://asendure.wordpress.com/">Mr sysadmin AsenDURE</a> didn&#8217;t have an answer for it either, so I went back to do more googling which one of them actually fixed it. Although the installer (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Installer">msi</a>) file was on the hard disk locally, it was in a network share which Windows Server 2003 disapproves of. After moving the file to an unshared directory, the install process was completed without any issues. That&#8217;s Windows I guess. ;)

Another thing which I&#8217;ve learnt after the first week is not to run services/applications which were built for *nix on Windows. I had heaps of problems in migrating <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">CVS</a> to <a target="_blank" href="htp://subversion.tigris.org/">SVN</a> which would never have been an issue had it been a *nix box.
