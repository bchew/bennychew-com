I&#8217;ll just lift the description off the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/index.html">Google Browser Sync</a> page :P

> Google Browser Sync for Firefox is an extension that continuously synchronizes your browser settings â€“ including bookmarks, history, persistent cookies, and saved passwords â€“ across your computers. It also allows you to restore open tabs and windows across different machines and browser sessions.

I don&#8217;t think I need to further expand on that. :P I have yet to try it out, but will do so shortly since I frequently switch between my desktop and notebook and could be a better option to my current setup of using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.2brightsparks.com/freeware/freeware-hub.html">Syncback</a> to do the synchronisation/backups between the two for the browser side of things.

<a target="_blank" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/">Google Spreadsheets</a> on the other hand allows you to create, store and share spreadsheets. Currently still under Google Labs, it&#8217;s aimed more towards those who constantly send spreadsheets to and fro via email. You can apply to try it out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/googlespreadsheets/try_out.html">here</a>. A writeup on it can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=06/06/08/1831210&#038;from=rss">here</a>.
