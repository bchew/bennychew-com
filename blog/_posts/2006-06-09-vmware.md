VMware now makes it extremely easy if you want to try out various &#8216;appliances&#8217; on your current operating system (probably Windows) without requiring you to meddle with your current setup. All you need is to download and install the free <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vmware.com/download/player/">VMware Player</a> and then <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/appliances/directory/">choose the appliance</a> which interests you, download and load it up in VMware Player. You can then freely experiment with the appliance you have loaded up and easily throw it off when you no longer want it. ;)
