Domains are really cheap nowadays, however finding the right hosting provider which offers reliability, adequate space and features you need at a reasonable price can be tricky (I&#8217;m happy with my current host though ;)). Google now offers to handle your hosting and email for your domain for free via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/a/">Google Apps for Your Domain</a> which could be handy if you&#8217;re still in the process of selecting a web host.

I&#8217;m using it for email accounts on the <a target="_blank" href="http://spherebox.com/">spherebox.com</a> domain and it has alleviated the need of space on my hosting server. The mail interface is similar to <a target="_blank" href="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a>, so if you&#8217;re comfortable with using Gmail, you wouldn&#8217;t have any issues with using this. Page Creator is the application with supports the creation and hosting of web pages, however I have not tried this out.
