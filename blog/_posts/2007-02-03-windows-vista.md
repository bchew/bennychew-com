<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> very recently released <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/default.mspx" target="_blank">Windows Vista</a> to the general public with heaps of fanfare, with even <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4suTsIIBWo" target="_blank">Bill Gates appearing on the Daily Show</a> to promote it. It would seem to me that this is probably one of the few releases of Windows of all time with a very lukewarm response from the public and <a href="http://www.little-gamers.com/index.php?comicID=1530" target="_blank">this comic</a> pretty much sums it up nicely. :P Or maybe M$ might&#8217;ve to resort to something like <a href="http://www.bbspot.com/News/2007/01/windows-xp-sp3-vista.html" target="_blank">this</a> to get people to upgrade.

Jokes aside, <a href="http://ck.spherebox.com/" target="_blank">ck</a> has a <a href="http://spherebox.com/2007/02/01/microsoft-windows-vista-home-premium-review/" target="_blank">review up at spherebox</a> if you&#8217;re interested to read more about it. :)
