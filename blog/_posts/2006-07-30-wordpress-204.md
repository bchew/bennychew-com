It was <a target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.org/development/2006/07/wordpress-204/">released</a> earlier today and is noted to have fixed a lot of security vulnerabilities, so I those who are running <a target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> blogs themselves should update soon.

Have just updated blogs hosted on spherebox. :)

Edit: You can get only the changed files in a zip which would save the time needed in uploading <a target="_blank" href="http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2006/07/30/wordpress-204-upgrade-changed-files-zip-changes-diff-changed-files-list/">here</a>.
