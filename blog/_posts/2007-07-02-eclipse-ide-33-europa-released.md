![Eclipse](https://bennychew.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/eclipse_logo.gif)If you&#8217;re developing in <a href="http://java.sun.com/" target="_blank">Java</a> and have not used <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> before, you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re missing out. :)

Probably would test out the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/main.php" target="_blank">Web Tools</a> project of the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/europa/" target="_blank">Europa</a> release as web services and distribution seems to be my domain at work in recent times..
