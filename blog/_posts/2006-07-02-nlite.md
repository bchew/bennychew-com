  Here&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.msfn.org/comments.php?shownews=17557">MSFN</a>&#8216;s brief description of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nliteos.com/index.html">nLite</a>:

> Have you ever wanted to remove Windows components like Media Player, Internet Explorer, Outlook Express, MSN Explorer, Messenger&#8230;How about not even to install them with Windows ?

> nLite is a tool for permanent Windows components removal and pre-installation Windows setup. After removal there is an option to make bootable image ready for burning on cd or testing in virtual machines. With nLite you will be able to have Windows installation which on install doesn&#8217;t include, or even contain on cd, unwanted components.

With the release of version 1.0 final, it should be relatively &#8216;stable&#8217;. ;) Haven&#8217;t had the chance to try it out yet, but I&#8217;ll give it a shot sometime soon. It would&#8217;ve been a great time saver if it had been released earlier judging by the amount of formatting and setting up of PCs I&#8217;ve done over these years. :(
