It&#8217;s been a while since my last post, unfortunately have been extremely busy with all kinds of things lately. :( Had some time this weekend, so <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/01/ella-21/" target="_blank">WordPress 2.1</a> has been deployed to all hosted sites. Unfortunately, there are some plugins which still have not been fixed to work with 2.1 (e.g. video embedding).
