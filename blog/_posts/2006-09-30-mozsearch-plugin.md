<a target="_blank" href="http://asendure.wordpress.com/">AsenDURE</a> messaged me on MSN yesterday about having a search plugin for any site integrated into Firefox. After having a look at it, I gave it a shot and now this site has a search plugin which you can install into Firefox 2.0 and search directly from the search bar. ;)

Following the steps from <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Creating_MozSearch_plugins">here</a>, your currently selected search plugin (by default Google) would glow blue when it automatically detects a search plugin. And the following screenshots on how to add and use it are rather self explanatory.

Adding it:

Using it:
  
<img id="image101" alt="MozSearch_2" src="https://bennychew.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/opensearch_2.png" />

There should be a 16&#215;16 icon image for it, but I don&#8217;t have one for it now though. ;)
