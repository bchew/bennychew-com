There are probably a lot of sites as well as utilities that do this (been using <a target="_blank" href="http://timeanddate.com/">timeanddate.com</a> after being told about it by <a target="_blank" href="http://hankern.spherebox.com/">Han Kern</a> long ago), but since AsenDURE posted it on his blog, I read about it, started using it and I found it nifty, I thought I&#8217;ll mention it as well. ;)

Once all the clocks are set, it just takes 1 click of the EngNet icon in the system tray to pop the details up.
