I decided to find out if cross streets (intersections) can be easily searched via Google Maps rather than searching for one street and just scrolling around to find the intersection with the other recently, and realised there was a keyword to do that.

For e.g., typing a very frequently used rendezvous point into Google Maps:

> Swanston St at Bourke St VIC 3000

Would give you the intersection of Swanston St and Bourke St (ex-Nike Melbourne). Link to the page <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=swanston+st+at+bourke+st+vic+3000" target="_blank">here</a>.

Pretty nifty since it&#8217;s common place for shop lot locations to be listed as &#8216;corner X road and Y road&#8217;.
