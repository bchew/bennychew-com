Previously only a rumour, but it has now been <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ati.com/companyinfo/about/amd-ati.html">confirmed</a> that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amd.com/">AMD</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ati.com/">ATI</a> will be merging. I don&#8217;t have much to comment on this but I do have a link to a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbspot.com/News/2006/07/amd-ati-daamit.html">satirical news piece</a> done by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbspot.com/News/2006/07/amd-ati-daamit.html">BBspot</a> on it.Â  ;)
