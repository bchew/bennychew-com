Just got some height/width/depth specifications of a new mobile phone and are unable to compare it visually yourself? <a href="http://www.sizeasy.com/" target="_blank">sizeasy</a> does an excellent job at this and only requires you to enter the dimensions.

3D view comparison between an iPod nano and a pack of playing cards:

Didn&#8217;t grab the screenshots for the other views, so if you want to check out the other views, just try it out yourself. ;)
