There has been update to the ipfilter.dat source which I <a href="https://bennychew.com/blog/2006/08/14/blocking-bad-data-and-peers-in-bittorrent/" target="_blank">posted up before</a> (have just updated that post). The previous source was from <a href="http://www.bluetack.co.uk/forums/index.php" target="_blank">BISS</a> but the people who maintain the blocklists now publish it at <a href="http://tbg.iblocklist.com/" target="_blank">this site</a>.

Whether or not the blocklists are of any use is up for debate, and definitely not something I&#8217;m going to go into in this post..
