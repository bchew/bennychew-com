<a target="_blank" href="http://www.opensourcewindows.org/">Open Source Windows</a> has a pretty neat list of free open-source software for Windows grouped into various categories. I would say it&#8217;s a good place to start for those who are searching for an open-source/free alternative to the software they are currently using as they have handpicked the cream of the crop for each category.

While on open-source, I came across <a target="_blank" href="http://osswin.sourceforge.net/games.html">this page</a> which has a list of open-source games for Windows. Haven&#8217;t tried any of them though. ;)
