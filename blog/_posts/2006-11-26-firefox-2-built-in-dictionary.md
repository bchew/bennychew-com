To me, it&#8217;s a rather welcomed feature since I use web applications and services quite a fair bit (I don&#8217;t misspell a lot, but automated checking is a bonus I guess ;)), but by default, the bundled dictionary is for the US locale which would complain when you spell &#8216;_favour_&#8216; instead of &#8216;_favor_&#8216;.

Fortunately, it&#8217;s a rather easy to get around this, which is just to select and install the appropriate dictionary from <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/dictionaries/?lang=en-GB">here</a>. Once that&#8217;s done, just right-click on any text box/field/form and you should be able to select the dictionary you want to use (screenshot below):

Once that&#8217;s done, you&#8217;re all set! :)
