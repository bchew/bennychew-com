CK was telling me that Box.net no longer have free signups, but that wasn&#8217;t the case when I tried. And so we both took screenshots..

Accessed from Melbourne, Australia:

Accessed from KL, Malaysia:

Apparently the signup page differs if you have an IP from Malaysia! I told him to try using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.atunnel.com/">ATunnel</a> to verify that, and true enough, he was able to sign up. I guess bandwidth abuse by Malaysians is pretty rife..
