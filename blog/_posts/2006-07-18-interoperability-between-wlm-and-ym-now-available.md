I mentioned about this feature being missed out when WLM came out of beta in a previous blog entry, and well, it&#8217;s now available. I&#8217;ve been messaging with a friend who&#8217;s on Yahoo! Messenger and it has been working rather flawlessly. Offline messaging between the 2 networks seem to work fine as well.

Those using YM will have to be using the latest beta version for this to work though. Do also note that M$ still terms this functionality as a beta, so you would have to accept an agreement before you are able to start using this feature.

Info for WLM <a target="_blank" href="http://ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=7adb59de-a857-45ba-81cc-685ee3e858fe">here</a>.

> Yes. As long as your friends have the beta version of Yahoo! Messenger with Voice, youâ€™re set. When you add them to your contact list, theyâ€™ll get all the information they need to gear up and connect with you.
