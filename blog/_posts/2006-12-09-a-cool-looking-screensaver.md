I&#8217;m not a big fan of screensavers as I have them disabled on every PC I use and instead have a 3 minute display timeout to standby mode if the display is a LCD monitor. But if you are and would like to have a cool looking one, try <a target="_blank" href="http://www.electricsheep.org/">this</a>.

2 of my workmates using Macbook Pros have that screensaver installed, but at the moment I&#8217;m quite happy with a blank black screen.. :D
