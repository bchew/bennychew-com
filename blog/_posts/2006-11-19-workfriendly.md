If you&#8217;re in work environment which utilises Microsoft Word a lot for work, you could try <a target="_blank" href="http://www.workfriendly.net/">workFRIENDLY</a>. It basically allows you to surf most sites in a Word-like interface.

I&#8217;m not going to go into the ethical issues of such an application, neither am I supportive of that behaviour and I do wish to be held responsible if your superior finds out. :P
