<a href="http://mail.google.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://bennychew.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/logo1.gif" alt="Gmail logo" align="left" /></a>An updated version of <a href="http://mail.google.com/" target="_blank">Gmail</a> was recently rolled out to most users just after <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2007/10/imap-access-now-available-for-all-users.html" target="_blank">IMAP</a> access was released, and I got it pretty early on. However, I somehow got reverted back to the old version a few hours later and never actually figured out why, till now..

Apparently, after I got moved over to the <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/10/gmails-new-version-is-now-available.html" target="_blank">new version</a>, I actually switched my language preference in the settings from English (US) to English (UK). :| I sort of left it as it is since then and finally decided to find out the root cause today (after much cursing at how evil it was for me to be given access to the updated version for just a few hours..).

So if you still seem to be stuck in the old version, try the following (was suggested <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Mail-POP-and-Forwarding-uk/msg/4bb3dfcfa535db67" target="_blank">here</a>):

  1. Click &#8216;Settings&#8217; in your Gmail window (top right, close to &#8216;Sign Out&#8217;).
  2. In the drop down for &#8216;Gmail display language&#8217;, change it to &#8216;English (US)&#8217;.

Oh well, Gmail is still in beta..
