You probably would&#8217;ve come across sites like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://video.google.com/">Google Video</a>, very likely from links sent by friends. If the thought of saving the clips ever crossed your mind, <a target="_blank" href="http://keepvid.com/">KeepVid</a> is a site which can do it easily.

To play the saved <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLV">FLV</a> files, video players such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC media player</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.martijndevisser.com/blog/article/flv-player-updated">FLV Player</a> would do the trick.
