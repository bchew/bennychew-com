<a target="_blank" href="http://www.miranda-im.org/">Miranda IM</a> is a very lightweight IM client supporting multiple networks and is heavily based on the original <a target="_blank" href="http://www.icq.com/">ICQ</a> client (which nobody uses anymore :(). I must say it brought back some memories of the days when I just got introduced to the world of IM. :D I decided to try it out as <a target="_blank" href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/">GAIM</a> crashed on me the moment I tried connecting and I didn&#8217;t want to have multiple IMs installed on the work laptop which had limited amount of RAM.

First issue I had was the inability to connect to <a target="_blank" href="http://talk.google.com/">Google Talk</a>, which <a target="_blank" href="http://www.khimhoe.net/">HMMaster</a> solved it for me by sending me <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.miranda-im.org/showpost.php?p=29347&#038;postcount=21">this link</a>. Next issue I had with it is the groupings I had with my contacts in <a target="_blank" href="http://messenger.msn.com/">MSN</a> are not available in Miranda. According to HMMaster, he said there might be a plugin available for that as Miranda as heaps of plugins available, but I have not checked on that as yet.

Apart from those issues, it&#8217;s a rather good alternative to other multi-network IM clients such as GAIM and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.trillian.cc/">Trillian</a>. :)
