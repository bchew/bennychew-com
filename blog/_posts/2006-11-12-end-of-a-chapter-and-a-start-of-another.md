Just had my last exam paper of my undergrad degree last Wednesday, which I guess, unofficially signifies the end (if all goes according to plan..).

Starting from tomorrow, I&#8217;ll be starting work at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.qdc.net.au/">QDC</a> as a software engineer. :D I&#8217;ll be dealing mostly with Java development stuff besides getting to play with <a target="_blank" href="http://zero.racetime.com.au/?act=show&#038;id=37112">some <em>toys</em></a>.

Unfortunately, there goes my post-exam vacation and late-waking-up schedule. :( I suppose I&#8217;ll have a short break when my parents come over for my graduation ceremony just before Christmas. That said, I guess I&#8217;m thankful that I&#8217;ve got a job before I even graduate. :D

Hmm, that&#8217;s all for this entry, I guess. Will try to keep my blog and spherebox updated with new entries/writeups when I can. ;) Hopefully I don&#8217;t get too busy. :)
