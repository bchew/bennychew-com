I already heavily use Gmail&#8217;s filters, but <a target="_blank" href="http://21st.blogspot.com/2006/09/use-gmail-generate-unlimited-e-mail.html">this trick</a> would greatly reduce the need to create heaps of filters for individual email addresses which I would want to group together.

> Gmail has an interesting quirk where you can add a plus sign (+) after your Gmail address, and it&#8217;ll still get to your inbox. It&#8217;s called <span style="font-weight: bold">plus-addressing</span>, and it essentially gives you an unlimited number of e-mail addresses to play with. Here&#8217;s how it works: say your address is <span style="font-style: italic">pinkyrocks@gmail.com</span>, and you want to automatically label all work e-mails. Add a plus sign and a phrase to make it <span style="font-style: italic">pinkyrocks+work@gmail.com</span> and set up a filter to label it <span style="font-style: italic">work</span> (to access your filters go to <span style="font-style: italic">Settings->Filters</span> and create a filter for messages addressed to <span style="font-style: italic"></span><span style="font-style: italic">pinkyrocks+work@gmail.com</span>. Then add the label <span style="font-style: italic">work</span>).
