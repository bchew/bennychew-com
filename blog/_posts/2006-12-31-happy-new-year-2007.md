The year 2006 has been pretty eventful year for me I guess, with the biggest &#8216;event&#8217; being the transition from full time studying to full time working. :-/ I had an enjoyable time while my parents and sis were around, unfortunately my bro stayed back to take care of my grandma.
  
Usual writeups would still be limited till I finish filling up the countless pages of PR application forms..

Anyway, have a good year ahead! :)
