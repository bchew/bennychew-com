Happy Chinese New Year (or Happy &#8216;Lunar New Year&#8217; as how my Vietnamese friends would refer to it :)) to everyone who are celebrating it! Unfortunately, this will be the first time I won&#8217;t be back in Malaysia for it due to unavoidable circumstances. :( I guess I won&#8217;t be putting on weight this time around. :P

Anyway, wherever you are, have a good celebration! :D
