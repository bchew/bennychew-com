Yes, it&#8217;s another _beta_ and invite-only product which was added to Google&#8217;s ever growing suite of web applications when they acquired the company behind it sometime back. From <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writely">Wikipedia</a>:

> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.writely.com/">Writely</a> is a web-based word processor currently in beta, and soon to be integrated into Google&#8217;s suite of web applications (following a 2006 acquisition). It can be used as a collaborative text editing suite, and features access controls. Writely&#8217;s user interface is a WYSIWYG word processor that appears within a web browser. Menus, keyboard shortcuts, and dialogue boxes show up in a way similar to what you would expect on a GUI-driven word processor, such as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.org.

You can read a review on it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.khimhoe.net/2006/08/02/18/">here</a> by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.khimhoe.net/">HMMaster</a>. And if you like it and want to try it out, post a comment here and I will send you one. ;) Once you&#8217;ve got an account, you can invite others by following the steps <a target="_blank" href="http://forum.lowyat.net/index.php?showtopic=321157">here</a>.
