About a month ago, I got some old computer parts from [Kah Wai](http://kahwai.spherebox.com/) which weren&#8217;t in use and set up a [headless](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless) server using the latest [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) [server edition](http://www.ubuntu.com/server). I stumbled upon [this guide](http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.06) which was excellent in guiding me through the process of setting it up and I would highly recommend it if you are new to setting up a server from scratch.

I&#8217;m pretty impressed by the [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) derived [package management system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool) which makes it very easy to add, remove or update almost any application available for it. I remember the times when I had to deal with all sorts of dependency errors when attempting to install stuff on [Mandrake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandriva_Linux) 9.0 (now called Mandriva). Besides the server services such as [Apache](http://www.apache.org/), [PHP](http://www.php.net/), [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/), I got [Samba](http://www.samba.org/) installed as well so it&#8217;s now also functioning as a dump box besides its primary function as a development server (not much so recently though..). :D
