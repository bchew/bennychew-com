As stated in the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page" target="_blank">WordPress&#8217;s Codex</a>, one of the steps in doing a proper upgrade of <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> is deactivating all plugins beforehand (and reactivating upon successful upgrade). Since I&#8217;m managing a number of WordPress sites, and each WordPress install has a fair bit amount of active plugins, doing this is a considerably arduous task and annoying (especially so since updates/upgrades get released often).

I was googling around for a quick fix for this and found <a href="http://www.wptextads.com/blog/2007/05/04/1-click-to-stop-start-plugins/" target="_blank">this plugin</a> which works a treat. :)

Now if only that can be added to my shell script which currently automatically grabs the latest.tar.gz and rsyncs all the separate installs to promote further efficiency and laziness..
