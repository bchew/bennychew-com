Downloaded and installed the latest security and critical updates for my Windows Server 2003, restarted, and WLM decided to not sign on. The odd thing was that it was actually connected to the .NET Messenger service, but it just won&#8217;t load up my contact list nor sign me on (the messenger icon was still swirling around for more than 20mins until I decided to shut it off). No error codes whatsoever and neither did it timeout by itself.

However, WLM seems to run fine after I installed all the updates on my Windows XP laptop which makes it even harder to pinpoint the fault. Tried GAIM but it crashed the moment I added an MSN account and tried to sign on. So I&#8217;m back to MSN 7.5.

To top it of, I&#8217;ve got a very sore throat and it&#8217;s..

.. a scorching 36 degrees now! :(

<strike>If there&#8217;s anyone with similar WLM symptoms and have solved it, do let me know..</strike>

**Edit:** It&#8217;s now working again, [check here](https://bennychew.com/blog/2006/10/19/windows-live-messenger-works-again/) for the steps to fix it.
