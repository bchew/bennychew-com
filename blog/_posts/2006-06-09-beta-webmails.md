<a target="_blank" href="http://gmail.google.com/">Gmail</a> caused a storm when it was launched by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> 2 years ago offering 1GB of space (now in excess of 2.7GB) and having a really slick interface. I&#8217;ve stuck to it ever since I got my invite and apart from a few disruptions, it has been the best webmail interface I&#8217;ve used so far. Invites are no longer scarce and you can even invite yourself over <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/accounts/SmsMailSignup1">here</a>.

The other 2 beta webmails I do use on and off are <a target="_blank" href="http://ideas.live.com/programPage.aspx?versionId=5d21c51a-b161-4314-9b0e-4911fb2b2e6d">Windows Live Mail</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/scp/viewer/index.php?client_id=1173&#038;event_id=16828">Yahoo! Mail Beta</a>. Both are invite only as well with overhauled interfaces to compete with Gmail.

Live Mail takes a lot of cues from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/outlook/">Microsoft Outlook</a> and is pretty decent but unfortunately I find the Internet Explorer-only requirement (loads up the standard <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hotmail.com">Hotmail</a> &#8216;classic&#8217; interface if you use Firefox) and the ads at the top and right of the page a tad too annoying (no <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1865/">Adblock extension</a> in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx">IE7</a> :P).

Yahoo! Mail Beta on the other hand took their standard interface and attempted to remodelled it with a look similar to <a target="_blank" href="http://messenger.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Messenger</a> which in my opinion, made the standard non-beta look and feel a lot better. It feels sluggish overall, which is especially apparent when scrolling. There&#8217;s supposed to be an ad on the right hand side as well, but Firefox&#8217;s Adblock extension probably made it disappear. :P Here&#8217;s a trick you can use to invite yourself to try Yahoo! Mail Beta yourself taken from <a target="_blank" href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2006/04/get-yahoo-mail-beta.html">this page</a>:

> * log in to Yahoo Mail
  
> * click Options
  
> * select Account information from the left panel
  
> * go to Member Information, General Preferences, Preferred Content
  
> * select, for example, Yahoo UK
  
> * click Finished
  
> * go to Yahoo Mail
  
> * you&#8217;ll see a page that says &#8220;It&#8217;s the New Yahoo! Mail Beta&#8230; and you&#8217;re invited.&#8221;
  
> * click on &#8220;Try Beta Now&#8221;.
