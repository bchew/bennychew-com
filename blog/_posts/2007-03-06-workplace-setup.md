Been a long time since I posted something, so here&#8217;s a post of my setup at work which was recently enriched with a very neat LCD. :D

A relatively dated Acer Aspire Pentium-M laptop, Acer AL2016W 20&#8243; wide screen LCD, <a href="http://spherebox.com/2006/12/02/logitech-mx400-review/" target="_blank">Logitech MX400</a> mouse, <a href="http://spherebox.com/2006/12/03/microsoft-comfort-curve-keyboard-2000-review/" target="_blank">Microsoft Comfort Curve 2000</a> keyboard and a.. kiwi soft toy (a gift from my colleague who went to NZ for a holiday some time back). The LCD&#8217;s 1680&#215;1050 is simply awesome. :D Now if only I could replace the 17&#8243; LCD I have in my room with that..

Hopefully I&#8217;ll have time soon to write more posts.. have been busy with shifting last week, followed by cleaning and clearing up the apartment to a habitable state. Hopefully <a href="http://leetlekid.com/" target="_blank">ck</a> will stop complaining once I start writing again.. soon. :P
