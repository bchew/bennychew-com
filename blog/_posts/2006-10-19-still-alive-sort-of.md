My apologies if you&#8217;ve come here in hope of reading something decent, haven&#8217;t got much time as I&#8217;ve been working flat out on my final year software engineering project for the past 2 weeks or so which resulted in lack of sleep, proper food and getting sick. :(

The client handover presentation was 2 days ago which would&#8217;ve supposedly spelt the end of the project cycle, but alas, some rather critical bugs surfaced on the day itself. I&#8217;ve spent most of yesterday fixing those up (and more bugs that magically cropped up) and would probably spend some time tonight reverting changes to a &#8216;bugfix&#8217; which was never a &#8216;bug&#8217; in the first place and preparing the patch for delivery to the client tomorrow.

Once this is over, I will just have 1 last exam before I&#8217;m done with my undergraduate degree. If all goes well, I&#8217;ll be done with uni by the end of the year. Ah..
