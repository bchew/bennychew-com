It&#8217;s been a while since <a target="_blank" href="http://www.invisionpower.com/">IPS</a> ceased to offer free unlimited trials of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.invisionpower.com/ip.dynamic/products/board/index.html">IPB</a> (Invision Power Board) and I&#8217;ve been trying out various forum software since, but most don&#8217;t seem to have the same level of usability as well as featureset as compared to IPB.

The venerable <a target="_blank" href="http://www.phpbb.com/">phpBB</a> has been around for years and wasn&#8217;t updated much till only recently when they released v3.0 beta1. I have not tested it out much, but v2 had a very weak admin control panel which I found annoying to use. It being a target of heaps of exploits don&#8217;t help much either. See v2 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/">here</a> and v3 <a target="_blank" href="http://forum.khimhoe.net/">here</a> _(via <a target="_blank" href="http://www.khimhoe.net/2006/06/20/phpbb3-beta-1/">KhimHoe.Net</a>)_.

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.simplemachines.org/">SMF</a> (Simple Machines Forum) v1.1 RC looked promising and decent aesthetically, but the admin CP was poor as well. I didn&#8217;t quite like how the code was modularised when I tried to modify the underlying code. See it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.simplemachines.org/community/">here</a>.

One forum software which I came across recently and sort of liked is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.punbb.org/">PunBB</a>. It&#8217;s very lightweight and quick and only contains the minimum functionality (even the PM function is left out! &#8211; a little absurd IMHO). <a target="_blank" href="http://www.punres.org/">Mods</a> to add functionality to it are quite plentiful, so you should be able to search for what you want and not code it up yourself. It&#8217;s probably a hassle for the initial set up, but this would definitely keep bloat to a bare minimum and allow the user to choose what he/she requires (similar to Firefox&#8217;s extension based system). See it running <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.punbb.org/">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://forum.utorrent.com/">here</a>.

I&#8217;ll probably stick to PunBB for now. Wikipedia has a long list of forum software <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_forum_software">here</a> in a comparison table.
