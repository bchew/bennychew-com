Had the opportunity to give a talk for a final year subject (Software Deployment and Evolution &#8211; HIT3311) at Swinburne last Monday, thought I&#8217;ll share the slides here as well (revolves around my experience with software over the past 6 years in industry after finishing uni).

Thanks again <a href="http://www.rvasa.com/" target="_blank">Rajesh</a> for this!
