I&#8217;ve finally decided to switch to <a target="_blank" href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a> permanently. I probably have been <a target="_blank" href="https://bennychew.com/blog/2006/10/08/woke-up-this-morning-and/">procrastinating</a> in <a target="_blank" href="https://bennychew.com/blog/2006/08/13/finding-a-replacement-for-bloglines-rss-reader/">doing this</a> for a long time since I&#8217;ve been using it for quite some time and am rather fond of it. :( Unfortunately, the incessant downtimes and also irregularities in feeds being updated recently was probably the final straw.

Google Reader seems to have fixed the scrolling bug with feeds only having 1 item and also the last item not marked as read which I <a target="_blank" href="https://bennychew.com/blog/2006/10/03/google-reader-and-bloglines-looks-gets-updated/">previously encountered</a> the last time.

Guess it&#8217;s pretty hard to compete with Google when the point is on reliability..
