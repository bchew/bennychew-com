Just a site I came across earlier today which (re)uploads the file you uploaded to multiple file upload sites (Megaupload, zSHARE, Sendspace, RapidShare were the ones used when I tried). Sendspace links weren&#8217;t working for me then (apparently being fixed) and Megaupload link only worked after some delay. Link to the site: <a href="http://www.sharebee.com/" target="_blank">Sharebee.com</a>

I don&#8217;t have much use for it, but if you&#8217;re into uploading files for multiple users to download from, this site would definitely cut the amount of time spent uploading to each different service. ;)
